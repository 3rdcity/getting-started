### What's Next
__Learn about Open Source__
* Open Source (and Free Software) is the philosophy that the source code for an program should be: free to study, free to modify, and free to share (plus modifications) with everyone. It encourages open collaboration, pushes technological advancements, and produces software (though it can apply to other fields) that is usually higher quality, more secure, and privacy conscious. For software to be open source, it must have an appropriate license included with it. More on licenses here.

### Working on a Project
* We use Git to manage all of our projects. It makes it easy to track code changes and have multiple people work on a project at the same time. Plus it's open source! Find out more about Git and how we use it on GitHub here.

* Before working on a project checkout their CONTRIBUTING.md file. It will explain where you can: find issues, ask questions, read documentation, how to style code, and how to submit changes. You can also ask the project lead for help.

* In addition to the LICENSE.md and CONTRIBUTING.md file, you may see a lot of other files that aren't code in a project repository. This explanation should help describe the different types of files you'll typically find in out open source projects. If you're creating a project, copying the project template will start you off with all the basic documentation you'll need.

###### Other Useful Things to Know
* [Club Resources] is a great place to find information about the club and different technologies we use. It also has our general coding guidelines and project template. It's open source, so feel free to add to it!
